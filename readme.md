## Deploy on your own

### Get your Personal Access Token (PAT)

For deploying your own instance of GitHub Readme Stats, you will need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). Below are the steps to create one and the scopes you need to select for both classic and fine-grained tokens.

Selecting the right scopes for your token is important in case you want to display private contributions on your cards.

* Go to [Account -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
* Click on `Generate new token -> Generate new token (classic)`.
* Scopes to select:
  * repo
  * read:user
* Click on `Generate token` and copy it.

### Deploying

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/asadahimeka/github-readme-stats.git
$ cd github-readme-stats
$ bun install
$ # Set .env file to specify the environment variables. 
$ # You can copy from `.env.example`
$ bun run start
```

## Available environment variables

GitHub Readme Stats provides several environment variables that can be used to customize the behavior of your self-hosted instance. These include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Supported values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CACHE_SECONDS</code></td>
      <td>Sets the cache duration in seconds for the generated cards. This variable takes precedence over the default cache timings for the public instance. If this variable is not set, the default cache duration is 24 hours (86,400 seconds).</td>
      <td>Any positive integer or <code>0</code> to disable caching</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>WHITELIST</code></td>
      <td>A comma-separated list of GitHub usernames that are allowed to access your instance. If this variable is not set, all usernames are allowed.</td>
      <td>Comma-separated GitHub usernames</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>GIST_WHITELIST</code></td>
      <td>A comma-separated list of GitHub Gist IDs that are allowed to be accessed on your instance. If this variable is not set, all Gist IDs are allowed.</td>
      <td>Comma-separated GitHub Gist IDs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>EXCLUDE_REPO</code></td>
      <td>A comma-separated list of repositories that will be excluded from stats and top languages cards on your instance. This allows repository exclusion without exposing repository names in public URLs. This enhances privacy for self-hosted instances that include private repositories in stats cards.</td>
      <td>Comma-separated repository names</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FETCH_MULTI_PAGE_STARS</code></td>
      <td>Enables fetching all starred repositories for accurate star counts, especially for users with more than 100 repositories. This may increase response times and API points usage, so it is disabled on the public instance.</td>
      <td><code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!WARNING]
> Please remember to redeploy your instance after making any changes to the environment variables so that the updates take effect. The changes will not be applied to the previous deployments.
